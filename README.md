# Ionic 3 hotel client
This repository is the client part of a application to book rooms based on search criteria.
It's relatively simple, uses basic Ionic components in it's structure, with a elaborated CSS styling.

![Dependencies status](https://david-dm.org/dnchia/Ionic3-hotel-client.svg)

## How to use it
The demo can be executed like any other Ionic application, using the Ionic CLI command: `ionic serve` to execute it in development mode.

### Configuration
Is configured to work in localhost, connecting with the server in localhost:8080. Actually the configuration is hardcoded inside RoomsProvider.
Will be modified and improved.

## References
The application was build initially following the tutorial made by Joshua Morony 
([@joshuamorony](https://github.com/joshuamorony)) in 
[Building a Hotel Booking App with Ionic 2, MongoDB & Node](https://www.joshmorony.com/building-a-hotel-booking-app-with-ionic-2-mongodb-node/).

## In the future
This repository will be refactored and several changes will be done to increase the functionality, and to change the design.
